<h1>Report Countinious Assessment<h1>

To develop this project it was necessary to use videos made in the classroom and mongoosejs, npmjs, MongoDB and postman.
A web application API was developed using Node.js, which can perform CRUD operations on a Mongo database.
Transports were chosen for data storage and I tried using String, Numbers and Booleans.
The code was done in Visual Studio and the following body-parser, express and mongoose dependencies were installed.
This app includes all CRUD operations requested by the speaker:
• Create (post-request - http: // localhost: 3000 / transports /)
• Read (get request - http: // localhost: 3000 / transports /)
• Update (place request - http: // localhost: 3000 / update /: id)
• Delete (delete request - http: // localhost: 3000 / delete /: id ')
